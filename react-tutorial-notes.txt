a react component is a js function that produces html
jsx (html in js -> react) - babel translates it to plain js via react create element
when we want to create an instance of a component, wrap it in jssx <App/>
function component (has no state, is simple js function that returns html) vs class component
- handling user events (search bar onChange)
- state, when the state of a component changes, it's rerendered along with its child components
- controlled input (value set to state)
- redux is predictable state container for js apps, react is the views
- app state designed is critical
